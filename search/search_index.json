Topic 1: Version Control with GitHub Explanation Why it's needed : Version control systems like GitHub are essential for managing changes to code, enabling collaboration, and maintaining a history of project changes. Historical Methods : Earlier methods included manual versioning and centralized systems like SVN, which had limitations in collaboration and version control. Theory Key Git Concepts Concept Kurzgesagt Definition Function 1. Repositories Central storage for project code and history. A repository (or \"repo\") is a storage location for software projects. It contains all the files, directories, and the history of changes (commits) for a project. Repositories are used to organize and manage the codebase, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on the same project. Each repository can be cloned to a local machine, where changes can be made and then pushed back to the remote repository. 2. Commits Snapshots of changes with metadata for tracking progress. A commit is a snapshot of changes made to the files in a repository. Each commit records the state of the project at a specific point in time. Commits are used to track changes in a repository. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash) and includes metadata such as the author, timestamp, and a commit message describing the changes. This makes it easy to review the history of changes and revert to previous states if necessary. 3. Branches Parallel versions of the codebase for isolated development. A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It diverges from the main codebase (often called \"main\" or \"master\") to allow for independent development without affecting the stable codebase. Branches are used to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas. Once changes on a branch are tested and verified, they can be merged back into the main codebase. This allows for isolated development and easier management of different versions of the project. 4. Merges Combining changes from different branches into one. A merge is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. This often involves combining the contents of different branches and resolving any conflicts that arise. Merges are used to consolidate changes from different branches, ensuring that all updates are incorporated into the main codebase. This is a critical step in collaborative development, allowing multiple branches to converge into a single, unified project. 5. Pull Requests Mechanism for submitting, reviewing, and merging contributions. A pull request (PR) is a method for submitting contributions to a project. It allows developers to notify others about changes they've made in a branch and request that these changes be reviewed and merged into the main branch. Pull requests are used to facilitate code review and collaboration. They provide a platform for discussing changes, reviewing code, and ensuring that contributions meet the project's standards before being merged. This process helps maintain code quality and encourages team collaboration. 6. Private Repositories Restricted access, ideal for confidential or internal projects. Private repositories are repositories that are only accessible to the repository owner and specific collaborators who are granted access. They are not visible to the general public. Used for proprietary projects, internal development, or any work that should not be publicly accessible. Only authorized users can view, clone, and contribute to the repository. 7. Public Repositories Open access, suitable for open-source and community collaboration. Public repositories are repositories that anyone can access. They are visible to everyone, and anyone can clone or download the code. Ideal for open-source projects, sharing knowledge, and collaboration with a wider community. Contributions can be made by anyone through pull requests, making it a key tool for open-source development. 8. Collaboration Tools Features like issues, pull requests, project boards, code review, and wikis to enhance teamwork and project management. Collaboration tools in GitHub are features and integrations that facilitate teamwork and project management. These tools help coordinate efforts, manage tasks, and communicate effectively within a team. Issues : Track tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. Pull Requests : Review and discuss proposed changes before merging them. Project Boards : Organize and prioritize work using Kanban-style boards. Code Review : Review changes and leave feedback on pull requests. Wikis: Document your projects and share knowledge within the team. 9. GitHub Actions for CI/CD Automates building, testing, and deploying applications through customizable workflows triggered by repository events. GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform that automates the build, test, and deployment processes of your applications. It allows you to create workflows that are triggered by events within your repository. CI (Continuous Integration): Automatically build and test your code every time a change is pushed to the repository, ensuring that new commits do not break the project. CD (Continuous Deployment): Automate the deployment of your application to various environments (e.g., staging, production) after passing all tests and checks. Workflows: Defined using YAML files, these workflows specify the actions to be performed in response to specific events, such as pushes, pull requests, or scheduled intervals. Runners: Servers that execute the workflows. GitHub provides hosted runners, but you can also use self-hosted runners for more control over the environment. Improvements and Modern Methods Better Collaboration : Use of pull requests and code reviews. Pull Requests (PRs) : A pull request is a method for proposing changes to a repository. It allows developers to request that someone review and merge their changes into another branch, typically the main branch. Example : Developer Alice creates a new branch feature-xyz from the main branch. She makes her changes and pushes feature-xyz to the remote repository. Alice then opens a pull request from feature-xyz to main , adding a detailed description of the changes. Reviewers can comment on specific lines, suggest changes, and ultimately approve the PR for merging. Code Reviews : The process of systematically examining code changes by other developers before merging them. Example : Bob reviews Alice's pull request. He notices a potential issue in the logic. Bob leaves a comment on the specific line of code and suggests an alternative approach. Alice makes the recommended changes and updates the PR. After a few iterations, Bob approves the PR, and it gets merged into the main branch. Automation : Integrating CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions. CI/CD : Continuous Integration (CI) involves automatically building and testing code changes as they are made. Continuous Deployment (CD) extends this by automatically deploying the code to production once it passes all tests. GitHub Actions : A CI/CD platform provided by GitHub that allows you to automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository using YAML files. Example : Workflow Configuration: Create a .github/workflows/ci.yml file. The workflow below runs every time there is a push or pull request. It checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs tests. name: CI on: [push, pull_request] jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Set up Node.js uses: actions/setup-node@v2 with: node-version: '14' - run: npm install - run: npm test Security : Using branch protection and security policies. Branch Protection : GitHub provides branch protection rules to enforce specific workflows and quality checks before merging. Example : Require pull requests to be reviewed before merging. Enforce status checks to pass before merging. Restrict who can push to the branch. Security Policies : These include setting up security policies, using Dependabot for automated dependency updates, and enforcing code scanning to identify vulnerabilities. Example : Create a SECURITY.md file to outline the security policies and procedures. Enable Dependabot to automatically open pull requests for outdated or vulnerable dependencies. Configure code scanning tools like CodeQL to scan the repository for potential security issues. Interesting Facts Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. GitHub hosts over 100 million repositories as of 2024. Code reviews have been shown to reduce the number of defects in software significantly. Linus Torvalds, creator of Git, emphasized the importance of code reviews in maintaining the quality of the Linux kernel. CI/CD automation can reduce the average time to resolve issues by up to 20%. GitHub Actions allows you to create custom actions, enabling reusable workflows across multiple projects. GitHub Dependabot can automatically create PRs to update dependencies, helping maintain security without manual intervention. Branch protection rules can be customized to fit the specific needs of a project, providing flexibility and control over the development workflow. Quiz What is a Git repository? A Git repository is a storage location for a software project, containing all files, directories, and the entire history of changes. It allows multiple developers to collaborate by tracking changes, merging updates, and maintaining versions. Explain the difference between git pull and git fetch. git fetch downloads updates from the remote repository to the local repository without merging them into the working directory. git pull fetches the updates and immediately merges them into the local branch, updating the working directory. What is a pull request? A pull request is a method for submitting changes to a repository. It allows developers to notify others about the changes they've made, request reviews, and discuss potential modifications before merging the changes into the main branch. How do you revert a commit in Git? To revert a commit, use the git revert <commit-hash> command, which creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by the specified commit, preserving the history. What are GitHub Actions used for? GitHub Actions are used to automate workflows, such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD). They allow you to build, test, and deploy your code based on events like pushes, pull requests, and scheduled tasks. Define branching in Git. Branching in Git involves creating separate lines of development within a repository. Branches allow you to work on features, fixes, or experiments in isolation from the main codebase, and later merge them back when ready. What is the purpose of a .gitignore file? A .gitignore file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore and not track. This is useful for excluding files that are generated during development, such as build artifacts, temporary files, and sensitive information. How can you protect a branch in GitHub? You can protect a branch in GitHub by enabling branch protection rules, which can include requiring pull requests for changes, enforcing status checks, requiring reviews before merging, and restricting who can push to the branch. What command is used to stage changes in Git? The command git add <file> is used to stage changes, marking them for inclusion in the next commit. You can stage all changes with git add . .
